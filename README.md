# Github Finder React App

This project was built as part of Brad Traversly's React Front to Back course. The course covers the fundamentals of react. Initially the Github Finder was built using class based components before refactoring to functional components and using Context API.

The app is hosted on netlify and can be seen here https://rob-github-finder.netlify.app/

The purpose of the app is to search Github to find contacts, if you thn click on a contact you can see more information including the 5 most recent repos and a link to their github page. The back button will take you back to the search page where the clear button will clear the results. If you try to search without typing anything into the search bar you will see an alert, which has a timeout set to 5 seconds.
